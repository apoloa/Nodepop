DevOps
======

The Server is running in production mode in the server:

```
creativedevelopers.es
```

Parts
------

We have 3 parts in the server:

* Documentation: creativedevelopers.es
* API: creativedevelopers.es
* Information: ip

Installation in a server
------------------------

We have a Docker-Compose to run in a server with a MongoDB and we have a simple docker image to run in a server without 
MongoDB. In these repo in the folder scripts we have the docker-compose.yml.

The docker image run with pm2. http://pm2.keymetrics.io/

Structure Server
----------------
The server has 3 parts:

* nginx: Inverse-proxy with the node. This server do inverse proxy with the api and serve the static files. 
* node-pm2 (docker-composite): Docker container with pm2 and node. We have a volume in www folder (var) and the 
next enviroments:
 * DB = link or ip from the database. (default:localhost)
 * CLUSTER = boolean that run in cluster mode (default:false)
 * LOCALHOST = boolean that run api only in the 127.0.0.1 interface. (default:false)
 * PORT = int that run in the port (default:3000)
* mongodb (docker-composite): Docker containter with the mongodb. We have a volume for data folder.
